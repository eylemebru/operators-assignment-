 1. Class Creation:
 The Employee class is created with the properties: Id, FirstName, and LastName.

2. Operator Overloading:
   - The equality operator == is overloaded to compare two Employee objects based on their Id. If the IDs match, the two objects are considered equal.

3. Main Method:
   - In the Main method, two Employee objects are instantiated and compared using the overloaded == operator. The result is displayed on the console.

4. Comments:
   - The code includes comments explaining what each part of the code does.
